In this repository, you will find a database of invasive species that have spread or been identified at some point along the Western Mediterranean region.

This database is available in CSV format and contains information based exclusively on peer-reviewed scientific articles. In this file, you will find the updated scientific name of each species along with its DNA sequence specific to the COI-5P region. These sequences were obtained from BOLD and NCBI. It's worth noting that for each species, multiple sequences from different haplotypes are available.

The information is complemented with the following data: parent taxID, taxID, and a BOLD or NCBI ID, along with the taxonomic rank, which should always be "species."

This information was initially intended to serve as a tool for taxonomic identification through barcoding to detect Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) in the Mediterranean region.

It is important to highlight that this database has undergone a meticulous manual review and curation, line by line, with the primary objective of avoiding the inclusion of erroneous information, a common issue in conventional databases.

The first version of the database is currently available in this repository in the file 'NIS_list_database_v1.csv.' This version was used and evaluated for its effectiveness compared to conventional databases in the article by Zarcero et al. 2023. The results demonstrated a higher NIS detection rate with significantly higher match percentages compared to conventional databases.

Furthermore, you will also find the updated version in the file 'NIS_list_database_v2.csv' in the repository.
